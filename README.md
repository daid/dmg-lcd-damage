[3:12 AM] Cavencruiser: Is my screen gonna be stuck like this forever? I was playing game and watch gallery 2, and somehow the game crashed, leaving the scanline beam in place for, maybe 10 minutes. Now I have this seemingly permanent horizontal dark line burned into my screen. Someone also mentioned this on reddit, is this really permanent? (Its near the top) https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/fx7vmx/why_does_the_lcd_losing_power_at_the_wrong_time/<br/>

[3:16 AM] kevtris: it could be.  LCDs don't like DC on them.  if it doesn't go away after a few hours of use it most likely is permanent<br/>
[3:17 AM] Cavencruiser: Why would the lcd do that, if the game crashed?<br/>
[3:17 AM] kevtris: why did it get left on for 10 minutes after it crashed<br/>
[3:17 AM] CasualPokePlayer: wild code ended up disabling LCD (and probably outside of vblank)<br/>
[3:18 AM] kevtris: I don't think it can happen that way, since it powers down the LCD when you turn it off<br/>
[3:18 AM] kevtris: if the clock to the GB CPU stopped it could happen, but that would show up elsewhere<br/>
[3:20 AM] Cavencruiser: I cant believe this never happened the 30 years someone had it<br/>
[3:20 AM] Cavencruiser: And noone else really seems to have this problem either<br/>
[3:20 AM] Cavencruiser: With a permanent burned in line<br/>
[3:20 AM] Cavencruiser: Besides people who tried backlighting it<br/>
[3:21 AM] Cavencruiser: Which mine is unmodded<br/>
[3:21 AM] kevtris: that is what happens if the LCD scan stops and DC is left on there.  it can happen to any LCD.  you just had the bad luck of it happening<br/>
[3:21 AM] kevtris: bad connection to the LCD, or the crystal is intermittent is pretty much the only things that can cause it on a gb I'd think<br/>
[3:21 AM] Cavencruiser: Not a loose cart connection?<br/>
[3:22 AM] Cavencruiser: I can force my gb to do this, if I switch the power half on<br/>
[3:22 AM] kevtris: I don't think a loose cart can do it<br/>
[3:22 AM] kevtris: bad power, now that could do it<br/>
[3:22 AM] Cavencruiser: Maybe power switch?<br/>
[3:22 AM] kevtris: could be<br/>
[3:23 AM] kevtris:<br/>
Results of excessive DC component on a segmented LCD Extended operation of an excessive DC component on a static display, or segment LCD, can damage the display by electro-plating the electrode contact. Noticeable results of a damaged display can include a blurry segment (decrease in contrast) and the segments can become burned in.<br/>
[3:24 AM] Cavencruiser: I guess if its permanent, it's a brick<br/>
[3:24 AM] kevtris: if it doesn't go away after a few hours of use then yeah it probably is there to stay<br/>
[3:25 AM] Cavencruiser: I dont like that kind of stuff in the way of my gameplay<br/>
[3:25 AM] kevtris: since people are replacing the LCDs, I wonder if you could get a hold of one of the originals they remove<br/>
[3:27 AM] Cavencruiser: Would that be a whole lcd board?<br/>
[3:28 AM] kevtris: yeah unless you can solder<br/>
[3:45 AM] Cavencruiser: Why would it have to take a few hours if so?<br/>
[3:45 AM] Cavencruiser: Why not a few minutes?<br/>
[3:45 AM] Cavencruiser: It doesnt seem to be changing in the last 30 minutes<br/>
[3:45 AM] kevtris: well this is a chemical process that happened<br/>
[3:45 AM] kevtris: it physically changed the LCD material and electrodes<br/>
[3:46 AM] kevtris: I don't think it's reversible but it might fade with time<br/>
[3:46 AM] Cavencruiser: My brothers gameboy pocket had this same issue 4 years ago, and its completely gone now<br/>
[3:47 AM] Cavencruiser: He hardly uses it<br/>
[3:49 AM] Cavencruiser: It was much worse at first, but in the first 4 minutes, it started to fade, and just stopped there<br/>
[3:49 AM] kevtris: ah<br/>
[3:49 AM] Cavencruiser: I haven't been using it continuously, but it has been about 3 hours since it happened<br/>
[3:55 AM] PinoBatch: So YES turning off rendering at the wrong time can and does damage DMG and MGB LCDs.<br/>
[4:01 AM] Cavencruiser: I wonder how many gameboy there are floating around out there with damaged lcds like this by turning off rendering at the wrong time<br/>
[4:01 AM] Cavencruiser: Not mentioning the vertical line thing<br/>
[4:46 AM] kevtris: not many unless they are running homebrew code that isn't doing it right<br/>
[4:57 AM] Cavencruiser: Well this wasnt homebrew, this was a real game cart<br/>
[4:57 AM] Cavencruiser: Not even everdrive<br/>
[4:57 AM] kevtris: I know<br/>
[4:58 AM] Cavencruiser: It's an obscurity<br/>
[4:58 AM] Cavencruiser: :thonk~1:<br/>
[6:09 AM] Daid: While sucks for you. Thanks for confirming a long standing discussion on this being a real risk of damage.<br/>
[11:59 AM] Cavencruiser: Yes, so do not do this with homebrew programs, be very careful on when you turn of the lcd, as it's very fragile.<br/>
[12:21 PM] Cavencruiser: On the bright side, this is just the gameboy I use for play. I have two other ones in better condition that I keep in storage. Since this model I'm using is in such bad shape to begin with, I can just consider this incident more battle damage, lol.<br/>
[3:25 PM] Cavencruiser: I dont know if I'm making this up, but I left my gameboy plugged in all night playing a looped demoscene demo (punk.gb). The screen looks exactly the same as it did yesterday, but upon further inspection, it may seem like the line isnt as visable as it was before (maybe the different light sources effecting it differently and the different contrast settings play into this)<br/>

[3:29 PM] Cavencruiser: Doesnt the line seem more faint now?<br/>
[3:30 PM] Cavencruiser: Under the same light I took a pic of it last night too<br/>
[3:30 AM] Cavencruiser: [photo](photos/20210615_093207.jpg)<br/>
[3:30 AM] Cavencruiser: [photo](photos/20210615_093251.jpg)<br/>
[3:33 PM] Cavencruiser: Sorry about all the pics<br/>
[3:33 PM] Cavencruiser: I just wanted to give a better idea on how it looks now<br/>
[3:35 PM] Cavencruiser: This is how it looks on the other side of the light<br/>
[3:35 AM] Cavencruiser: [photo](photos/20210615_093459.jpg)<br/>
[3:36 PM] Cavencruiser: See how only certain angles make it more visible?<br/>
[3:36 PM] Cavencruiser: Why is this<br/>
[3:41 PM] pyroesp: because an LCD, like the name says, is a crystal suspended in liquid<br/>
[3:41 PM] pyroesp: the crystal turns depending on current going through it<br/>
[3:42 PM] pyroesp: making the screen go dark or not<br/>
[3:43 PM] pyroesp: usually crystals are either vertical (invisible) or horizontal (visible), viewing from the front like your gameboy<br/>
[3:43 PM] pyroesp: those are probably somewhere in between<br/>
[3:44 PM] pyroesp: and depending on the angle they block more or less light<br/>
[3:45 PM] pyroesp: at least that's my understanding of LCD<br/>
[4:14 PM] Cavencruiser: So, I have a question regarding the nes and its apu. Does the apu contain it's own seperate cpu to offload the sound engine to?<br/>
[4:15 PM] Cavencruiser: Some sites seem to hint toward this, and so does mame<br/>
[4:19 PM] PinoBatch: NES APU is just a PSG and a DMA-driven sample player<br/>
[4:20 PM] PinoBatch: It has a few rudimentary features to handle duration, fade, and sweep, but that's it for processing, and most games do those in software anyway for finer control.<br/>
[3:36 AM] Cavencruiser: This is what it looks like now under the same light tonight<br/>
[3:36 AM] Cavencruiser: [photo](photos/20210615_213615.jpg)<br/>
[3:37 AM] Cavencruiser: Doesnt it seem to be fading away?<br/>
[3:47 AM] Cavencruiser: I'm sorry for keep posting pictures, I just wanted to keep you guys updated on this issue, if anyone is interested if this is permanent or not.<br/>
[7:27 AM] Daid: I am very interrested. I plan on updating the pandocs to reflect this. Mind if I archive your posts somewhere for reference?<br/>
[12:31 PM] Cavencruiser: Yes, you can<br/>
